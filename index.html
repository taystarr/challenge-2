            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Florida native that started off my career in the medical field
                and moved to DC mid-pandemic. I graduated from Florida SouthWestern State College with my 
                nursing degree in 2017 and have since been a pediatric 
                critical care nurse. My love for coding started as a reprieve 
                from working in a hospital during the pandemic and has since blossomed 
                into something I genuinely enjoy and look forward to. <br />
                I started the coding bootcamp offered through George Washington University in February 2022, where 
                we cover a mix of front-end and back-end web development skills 
                including Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Express.js,
                SQL, PWAs, and more. My anticipated graduation date is July 2022.
