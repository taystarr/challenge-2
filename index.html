            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Florida born and recently moved to the DC area. 
                I started off my career in the medical field. 
                I graduated from Florida SouthWestern State College with my 
                nursing degree in 2017 and have since been a pediatric 
                critical care nurse. My love for coding started as a reprieve 
                from working in a hospital during the pandemic and has blossomed 
                into something I genuinely enjoy and look forward to. I started a 
                coding bootcamp offered through George Washington University where 
                we cover a mix of front end and back end web development skills 
                including working with Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Express.js,
                SQL, PWAs, and more. My anticipated graduation from the program is 
                in late July.
